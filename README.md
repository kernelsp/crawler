# crawler
Crawler written in PHP using Goutte and cURL to obtain seats availability from a travel company website


Steps to use the crawler:

Since this project depends on [Goutte](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Goutte), please be aware of the [requirements](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Goutte#requirements) and follow the [installation](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Goutte#installation) instructions provided on the project's page to install it.

Once you have Goutte installed, copy the `app.php` file into the folder that contains your project. The `app.php` file should be in the same level as your `vendor` folder.

*More instructions will be made available here, work in progress...*
